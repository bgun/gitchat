#Playing the Game- Intro Time!

:bowtie: 

Hi Everyone! I'm Joshelyn. I am a senior at York College and graduating this semester with major in Mathematics and minors in Youth Studies and Sociology. (FINALLY)

Just a plain Peruvian-American girl trying to understand coding/programming concepts. Hopefully one day I may create or contribute in creating a Math based game that students and adults can play and understand more on how math is applied in the real world.

Also I love puppies (mildly allergic to cats--but they are cute to stare)
