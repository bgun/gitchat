#Playing the Game- Intro Time!

:bowtie: 

Hi Everyone! I'm Joshelyn. I am a senior at York College and graduating this semester with major in Mathematics and minors in Youth Studies and Sociology. (FINALLY)

Just a plain Peruvian-American girl trying to understand coding/programming concepts. Hopefully one day I may create or contribute in creating a Math based game that students and adults can play and understand more on how math is applied in the real world.

Also I love puppies (mildly allergic to cats--but they are cute to stare)

> Ben: Hey Joshelyn! Great working with you at Access Code. Also I just learned something new from your file here - I didn't know Github's Markdown
supports emoji, like :bowtie: or :neckbeard:! I am super excited about this. :statue_of_liberty: :santa: :raised_hands:

> Ben: Also we should talk about conventions sometime - I remembered your "interesting fact" about Comic-Con. I help direct a science fiction convention
in Atlanta (now in its 7th year), so I'm familiar with the territory. They're a lot of fun. :D

> Joshelyn: Thanks Ben! You and the rest of the TAs are super helpful and patient :octocat: That's so cool about the Sci-fic convention! I wanted to
expand my trips to see conventions like San Diego Con, Katsucon and MagFest. What's the name of the convention you helped direct?

> Ben: [JordanCon](http://jordancon.org). It's coming up in two weeks and I still have a lot of work to do - aah!
