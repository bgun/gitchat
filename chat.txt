Git chat!
=========

bgun: hey everybody!

bgun: Use this file as a chatroom. Or create your own! You can use this repo as a big sandbox; create
your own text files and folders to make little discussions, or just be creative.

yuliya: Hi everybody! Glad that bgun came up with this awesome idea to practice git skills! Two thumbs up. The question is how to use cat.gif=)?

bgun: catgifs is a folder - you can add files to it, add them and push them like any other file.
This file (chat.txt) is just a text file so it can't display images, but explore the Markdown files (ending in .md)
and maybe you'll discover a way to link images! :)
