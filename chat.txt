Git chat!
=========

bgun: hey everybody!

bgun: Use this file as a chatroom. Or create your own! You can use this repo as a big sandbox; create
your own text files and folders to make little discussions, or just be creative.

yuliya: Hi everybody! Glad that bgun came up with this awesome idea to practice git skills! Two thumbs up. The question is how to use cat.gif=)?

bgun: catgifs is a folder - you can add files to it, add them and push them like any other file.
This file (chat.txt) is just a text file so it can't display images, but explore the Markdown files (ending in .md)
and maybe you'll discover a way to link images! :)

yuliya: Thank you! I think I understand the game now.I have two questions, to view files.md I have to download a certain reader? or program? I cannot open Ben.md. The next question is as I can see you love cats=)?

bgun: You don't need a special reader to open .md files. You can open them in any text editor, but on Mac you may need to tell it which
program to use. Markdown files are just regular text files, with some extra formatting that can be shown as headlines, links, and so on.

And yes, I do love cats. The one in the picture is my cat Annie - she's a Ragdoll breed. :) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ragdoll

yuliya: I thought it was just an Internet cat=)))) she is so adorable! The way you are folding her paws and her reaction is so funny. Do you have just one pet? 

sufei: Should we comment on other student's markdown files too?

ben: Certainly, start a conversation! I'll create some files for us to talk about topics, too. Check out [Community.md].
