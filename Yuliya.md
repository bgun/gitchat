German Sheperd is my dream
=================================

> I have been dreaming to have a German sheperd for about three years but because of lack of room in my apartment I cannot do it now. I just do not want to torture a living creature in uncomfortable living conditions. But I plan to get a bigger place in a year and get this piece of happiness=)!
