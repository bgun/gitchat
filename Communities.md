# Communities

> Ben: In this file, let's talk about communities or social groups that we're involved with or passionate about.

> Ben: I'm part of a non-profit called the [Waygate Foundation](http://waygatefoundation.org) that helps science and fantasy
fiction authors (dragons and robots are awesome! :alien:) who want to organize their readerships for charitable causes.
Many genre fiction authors, even ones that aren't "bestsellers" have audiences with hundreds of thousands or millions of
fans, and those authors want help organizing their influence for charities. Harnessing the power of social networks to help
a great cause is really fun work.

> Ben: Access Coders, what's a community or cause that's important to you?

> Sufei: I volunteer for New York Cares, which is a giant umbrella for all sorts of causes. You can sign up for whatever
causes interest you. I've done a few dog walks for the BARC animal shelter in Williamsburg, and helped renovate a community
center in LES. Unfortunately, I haven't had time to sign up for any of their projects recently. 

> Ben: @Sufei that's awesome! New York Cares is a great organization. I'm also too often short on free time, but should look
for some volunteer projects close to home.
