> Sufei: Side question...how do you know when to add origin master to the
> end of git push or git pull and when you don't need it?

> Ben: Great question! This has to do with something Git does internally called "branch tracking".
> When you `git push`, the next two words are called the remote ("origin") and the branch ("master").
> If you've cloned a repo, for example, Git automatically starts keeping track of where
> your code lives on GitHub. In that case you wouldn't need to to add `origin master` and a simple
> `git push` would be enough. However, I always use `git push origin master`, simply because
> I like knowing exactly where my code is going - even if it's a bit more to type. :)
